## Abstract

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are products of bacterial fermentation that help maintain important gut functions such as maintenance of the intestinal barrier, cell signaling, and immune homeostasis. The main SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate have demonstrated beneficial effects for the host, including its importance in alleviating infections caused by pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Despite the potential role of SCFAs in mitigating C. difficile infection, their direct effect on C. difficile remains unclear. Through a set of in vitro experiments, we investigated how SCFAs influence C. difficile growth, sporulation, and toxin production. Similar to previous studies, we observed that butyrate decreased growth of C. difficile strain 630 in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of butyrate also increased C. difficile sporulation, with minimal increases in toxin production. RNA-Seq analysis validated our experimental results, demonstrating increased expression of sporulation-related genes in conjunction with changes in metabolic and regulatory genes, such as a putative carbon starvation protein, CstA. Collectively, these data suggest that butyrate may induce alternative C. difficile survival pathways, modifying its growth ability and virulence to persist in the gut environment.
